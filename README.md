# Kaggle Project - Sleep Health and Lifestyle
## Exploring Sleep Health and Lifestyle Factors: Predicting BMI Category Based on Age, Gender, and Occupation 
### Numpy, Pandas, scikitlearn

## Overview:

In today's fast-paced world, understanding the factors influencing Body Mass Index (BMI) can provide insights into overall health and well-being. This project aims to uncover the relationships between BMI and several demographic factors, namely Age, Gender, and Occupation. Leveraging data from the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset, we implement predictive modeling techniques to forecast BMI categories.

## Key Highlights:

Data Analysis: Dive deep into exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns, distributions, and correlations within the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Optimization of input features to enhance model performance.
Predictive Modeling: Employ various machine learning algorithms to predict BMI categories based on Age, Gender, and Occupation.
Model Evaluation: Thoroughly evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
Insights & Findings: Draw insights on how Age, Gender, and Occupation play a role in influencing BMI.
